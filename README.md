# Priming attentional sets
Priming of attentional sets, an experiment using Geistesblitz game.

## Notebooks
* `01_preprocess_...`: load data and prepare for fitting.
* `02_fitting_...`: fit individual models.
* `03_analysis_...`: compute model comparisons and averages for selected subset of trials (interesting repetitions).
* `04_figures`: plot averages and posterior predictions for interesting repetitions across all experiments.

## Sampled draws
Please note that analysis notebooks assume sampled draws in `Draws` and `LogLik` folders to recompute statistic for figure and LOO comparisions. We did not include them due to their size but they can be resampled via `02_fitting...` notebooks. Alternatively, please contact me and I will provide files with draws via a file-sharing service.
